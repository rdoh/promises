# Promises Patterns & Anti-patterns

This is a do-it-yourself exercise in understanding promises, their usage patterns, and how to avoid common anti-patterns.

## How to

* Read through the [slides](Promises.pdf) to understand the terms used.
* Run `node` in a terminal.
* One block at a time, copy and paste each example from [promise-examples.js](promise-examples.js) into the terminal.
* Follow along with the comments in your favourite IDE.
